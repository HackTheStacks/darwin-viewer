As far as external characters are concerned, many races probably descended from the same stock differ far more than true species of the same genus;— look at the willow-wrens, some of which the skilful ornithologists can hardly distinguish from each other, except by their nests; look at the wild swans, & compare these distinct species with the races of domestic ducks,— the Dorking & Bantam fowls, the dogs, several pigeons— and so again with plants compare the cabbages, peaches & nectarines, or with the species of many genera. — St. Hilaire has even remarked that there is a greater difference in size between races ,as in dogs, (for he believes all have descended from one stock) than between the species of any one genus; nor is this surprising considering that amount of food &consequently growth is the element of change, over which man has most power.

I may recall a former statement, that Breeders believe the growth of one part or strong action of oneone function, draws now causes a decrease in other parts; for this seems analagous to the law of \"organic compensation\", which most naturalists believe holds good, with some exceptions; for instance, where thin those species of Carnivora, in which the canine teeth are greatly developed, certain molar teeth are deficient; or again in that division of the Crustaceans in which the tail is much developed, the body is little so & the carcase.   DAR 7: [58v] continued The variation or difference between races is often strikingly analagous to that between species of the same genus; trifling spots or marks of colour, as the bars on pigeons wings.

Seeing the contented face of nature on a bright summer\\'s day this may at first be well doubted; but reflection will inevitably prove it is too true. The war,, however, is not constant, but only recurrent in a slight degree at short periods & more severely at occasional longer onesmore distant periods, & hence its effects are easily overlooked. It is the doctrine of Malthus applied in most cases with ten-fold force. As in every climate there are seasons for each of its inhabitants of greater & less abundance, so all annually breed; & the Moral restraint, which in some small degree checks the increase of mankind is entirely lost. Even slow-breeding man-kind has doubled in 25 years, ‸& if he could increase his food with greater ease, he would double in less time. But for animals without arts,On anaverage, the amount of food for each species must be constant; whereas the increase of all organisms (if not destroyed) istends to be geometrical & in a vast majority of cases at an enormous ratio.

The cause of many exotic geraniums producing although in vigorous health imperfect pollen, seems to be connected with the period when water is given them; but in the far greater majority of cases, we can not form any conjecture on what exact cause the sterlility of organisms, taken from their wild natural conditions, depends.

Many naturalists, indeed, admit that all groups are artificial; & they depend entirely on the extinction of intermediate species. Some naturalists, however, affirm, that though beatendriven from considereing sterility as the characteristic of species, that an entire incapacity to propagate together is the the only good best evidence of the existence of natural genera. Even if we layput on one side the undoubted fact that some species of the same genus will not breed together, we cannot possibly admit such athe above rule, seeing that the grouse & pheasant (considered by some good ornithologists as forming two families) the bull-finch & canary-bird have bred together.]   No doubt the more remote two species are from each other, the weaker the arguments become in favor of their common descent.—InIn species of two distinct families, the anga analogy from the variation of domestic organisms, & from the manner of their intermarryingfails, & the arguments from their geographical distribution quite or almost fail.

We were thus led on to the consider the same questions with respect both to sop highly complicated organs, & to complicated the aggregate of several such organs, that is individual organic beings, & it was shown by the same method of taking the existing most imperfect series, that we ought not at once to reject the theory, because we cannot trace the transitional stages in such organs, or conjecture the transitional habits of such thesuch individual species.]   In the Second Part, the direct evidence of allied species & groupsof species having descended from the same stock was discussed. It was shown that this theory requires a long series of intermediate forms between the species & groups in the same classes,— forms not directly intermediate between existing species, but intermediate with thea common parent.

The caret was erased and the encirclement partly erased and altered to include \\'of organisms,\\', making one interlined phrase. The punctuation following \\'existed\\' and \\'required\\' was altered accordingly. This want of evidence of the past existence of almost infinitely numerous of intermediate forms is, I conceive, much the weightiest difficulty on the theory of common descent, but I am convinced it is due to ournecessary ignorance necessarily resulting from the imperfection of all geological records.]   [In the second Chapter, it was shown that new species gradually appear,& the old ones disappear from the earth, which strictly accords with our theory.

The difficulty, I believe is the same with that, which with most geologists it has taken years to remove, as when Lyell propounded that valleys were hollowed out by the slow action of the waves of the sea & of rivers.

Therefore if it could be shown, that the period of theeachevery eac slight successive variation does not alwaalways supervene at a very early period of life, the greater resemblance, or closer unity in type of animals in the young, than in the mature full-grown state would be explained. Before practically endeavoring to discover in our domestic races, whether the structure or form of the young has or has not changed in an exactly corresponding degree with the changes of the full-grown animals, it will be well to show, that it is at least quite possible for the primary germinal vesicle to be impressed with a tendency to produce some change on the growing tissues, which will not be fully effected, till the animal is advanced in life.]        '",

I may take this opportunity of remarking that Naturalists have observed that in most of the great classes, a series exists from very complicated to very simple beings;— thus in Fish, what a range there is between the Sand-eel & shark — in CrabsCrustaceansthe Articulata between the commmon Crab & the Daphne—in insects—, between the aphis & butterfly,—& between the mite &aa spider. Now the observation just made, namely that selection might tend to simplify, as well as to complicate, :explains this; for we can see, that during the endless geologico-geographical changes & consequent isolation of species, a station occupied in other districts by lower less complicated animals might be fil left unfilled & be occupied by a degraded form of a higher or more complicated class; & it would by no means follow that when the two regions became united that the degraded though higher organism would give way to the naturallyaboriginally lower organism.(A)The deleted insert (A) may be viewed  here, or below. According to our theory, there is obviously no power tending constantly to exalt species, though beyondexcept the mutual struggle ofbetween the different individuals & classes; thoughbut from the strong & general, tendency, we might expect to find some tendency to progressive complication in the successive creationsproductions of new organic beings forms.]   [In an early part of this discussion section, I stated that the forms, for instanceI have above remarked that the feline form, is quite of secondary importance to the fœtusembryo& to the young animal.

On the ordinary veiw of individual creations, I must think, that no scarcely any class of facts in the Natural History, are more wonderful or less capable of receiving explanation.]    Physiologists apply the term abortion in a somewhat diffferent sense from Naturalists; & their senseapplication is probably the primary one; namely to parts, which from accident or disease during the embryonic periodbefore birthare not developed or do not grow: thus when a young animal is born with little stump in the place of a finger or extreof the whole extremity or with a little button instead of a head, or with mere bead of bony matter instead of a tooth, or with a stump instead of tail, these parts are said to be aborted. Naturalists, howeveron the other hand, as we have seen, apply this term to stunt parts, not alteredwhich as arenot stunted & during the growth of the embryo, but which are as regularly produced in successive generations, as any other parts, essential to the life of the individual: Naturalists, therefore, use this term in a metaphorical sense.

We see this clearly in the fact, that it showst the highest skill to select the best form early in life, either in horses, cattle, or poultry; no one would attempt it only a few dayshours after birth; &it requires great discrimination to judge with nice accuracy even durng their full youth, & the best judges are sometimes deceived.

Hence it is not at all necessary for the bees to work on both faces of any one of the rhombs, or on all 3 rhombs at same time, nor do they so. He supposes that they can see these lines, on the opposite face, for so transparent is the wax, that he could possibly see them (with  eyes) whilst watching the  contents; or, owing to darkness of Hive, he imagines, that more probably they can feel with their antenna, which are incessantly playing on surfaces by the difference of elasticity of the wax, when these hexagonal lines are traced, which are in part elevated above the wall of wax & partly excavated in it, owing to difference in elasticity along them. That the lines in the opposite face formed by the union of 3 hexagonal outlines is the guide for unitingplaning the surfaces between them & the hexagonal outline on their own face, I think is rendered very probable, by observing an irregular comb or  in which part of 4 cells on one side will correspond with base of one on one side, & then the base of instead of being a trihedral pyramid, will consist of 4 faces of all sorts various & graduated dimensions.—(a) Back I have said that the cells of the first or attached row are different from the others & present some special difficulties; they are pentagonal, the surface of attachment replacing 2 sides of the hexagon, by which & by an analogous modification of the trihedral basin the attachment is manufactured rendered stronger for the hexagon is attached by 2 sides.

It has often been noticed with surprise, & the fact has been brought forward most distinctly in a talk by A. de CandolleAlphonse de Candolle, 1806-1893. DCP (Geograph. Bot. p. 986) that we owe none of our dom cultivated plants, to Australia, New Zealand, the Cape of Good Hope, &hardly to N America north of Mexico; & to this may be added America S. La Plata (& we Know how many temperate plants are cultivated.) though some of these countries are the richest in the world in diverse species.— [In evidentsee further on connection with this is the common remark that no new cultivated plants have been introduced for several centuries].— now if our cultivated plants are mostly in almost their aboriginalin the same state as when growing wild, the above fact of distribution would indeed be most singular, &perhaps seemin the opinion of many the more so, as we see by recent colonisation how eminintly well fitted theythese countries are for mankind: but if nearly all our cultivated plants are so greatly altered that their wild stocks are hardly recognizable, [& consequently that many X of the plants believed by A. de Candolle the wild stocks are only escaped seedlings as is the opinion of many very eminent men], then we can offer some explanation of the above facts for can see clearly that cultivated plants can arise only where man has been civilised to a pitchft sufficiently to cultivate the ground (which is usually subsequent to the Keeping of animals) for a very long period; as from selection it must take a very long period in most cases sensibly to acclimate plants.

(67 Production of Hybrids in a state of nature.Note Ch 6 Gærtner p. 583 to 606 (say little) As it has been an old hypothesis that the varied forms in many genera have resulted from the crossing of a few species, — a view even lately sustained by the Dean of Manchester.William Herbert (Dean of Manchester), 1778-1847. DCP. I may make a few remarks on the subject, & for a full discussion ، as far as regards plants, the reader may consult Gætner [* chapter give]. This latter author doubts, & apparently with good reason the far greater majority of reported cases, & shows that the intermediate character, others relied on, is not very trust worthy, as a very large proportion of really known hybrids are not exactly intermediate between their pure parent. Even sterility is not a sure test, as many examples in certain genera as in Dianthus & Verbascus occur from unknown cases sterile. But Gærtner does admit some cases. (Example?) Herbert—Crinum wild. Amaryllidae p 343Herbert 1837. See verso. But as these Hybrids in the far greater majority cases are in some degree sterile, as the pollen of either parent, which in most cases will be growing in the vicinity has perpetual effect over the pollen of the hybrid itself then will be the strongest tendency for the hybrid to die out from sterility or to be absorbed in a few generations in to either parent form. and tend of themselves to go back. if not selected.— So this may be added that very rarely will there be peculiar conditions present, which are better adapted to the structure & constitution of the hybrid then to either parent.

This is the first of a series of references to correlated variation, a class of phenomena that Darwin soon grouped as \\'Hunter\\'s Law\\' (See D67 and D112). Through the remainder of Notebook D, the opening paragraphs of Hunter\\'s \\'An account of an extraordinary pheasant\\' from the Animal Economy (Hunter 1837:44−45) play a comparable role to key passages of Erasmus Darwin\\'s Zoonomia in Notebook B. That is, they form a rich source of direct and indirect reference as Darwin seeks to understand the laws of generation. Hence, they are cited here in extenso. \\'Every deviation from that original form and structure which gives the distinguishing character to the productions of Nature, may not improperly be called monstrous. According to this acceptation of the term, the variety of monsters will be almost infinitea; and, as far as my knowledge has extended, there is not a species of animal, nay, there is not a single part of an animal body, which is not subject to an extraordinary formation. Neither does this appear to be a matter of mere chance; for it may be observed that every species has a disposition to deviate from Nature in a manner peculiar to itself a. It is likewise worthy of remark, that each species of animals is disposed to have nearly the same sort of defects, and to have certain supernumerary parts of the same kind: yet every part is not alike disposed to take on a great variety of forms; but each part of each species seems to have its monstrous form originally impressed upon itb.\\' Richard Owen\\'s notes follow: \\'a [p. 44] Mr. Hunter attempted, notwithstanding, to reduce this variety of monsters to definite groups, and left the following outline of a classification of monsters, in an explanatory introduction to the extensive series of those objects in his collection: “ 1. Monsters from preternatural situation of parts. “ 2. ———— addition, of parts. “ 3. ———— deficiency of parts. “ 4. ———— combined addition and deficiency of parts, as in hermaphroditical malformation.” . . . \\'a [P. 45] The value of the principle here enunciated will be appreciated, when it is stated that it is the basis of the latest and most elaborate work on the subject of monsters. It is claimed for Geoffroy St. Hilaire as the most important of his deductions in Teratology, and the chief point in which his system differs from, and is superior to, those of his predecessor. “ C\\'est de principes précisément inverses que mon père a pris sur point de départ; et c\\'est aussi, comme cela devait être à des résultats inverses qu\\'il est parvenu. Etablissant, par un grand nombre de recherches, que les monstres sont, comme les êtres dit normaux, soumis à des règles constantes, il est conduit à admettre que la méthode de classification que les naturalistes emploient pour les seconds, peut être appliquée avec succès aux premiers.” [Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire 1832−36, 1:99] \\'b [P. 45] In this principle Mr. Hunter is opposed to Geoffroy St. Hilaire, who attributed the production (l\\'ordonnée) of monstrosities to the operation of exterior or mechanical causes at some period of foetal development. Defective formation in parts of a foetus has indeed been produced by destroying a portion of the respiratory surface of an egg during incubation; but this result by no means affords adequate grounds for assigning as the sole cause of every malformation accidental adhesions between the foetus and its coverings. Mr. Hunter also made experiments with reference to monstrosities ... It is evident, however, from the expression in the concluding paragraph of the text, that he regarded the cause of congenital malformation as existing in the primordial germ.\\'   As Larvæ may be more perfect (as we use the word) than parent, so may species retrograde, but these facts are rare.— 2d Sept  Those animals which have many ABORTIVE organs, might be expected to have larvæ more perfect— this is applicable to young of Cochineal??

If prolongation of life by gemmation can be being impossible. can be overturned,See Knight 1818b:252, ‘The progressive influence of debility and decay upon old varieties of fruit trees is now so generally admitted, that it is wholly unnecessary to advance facts or arguments to prove it: the general law of Nature appears to be, that no living organized being shall exist beyond a limited term of years; and that law must be obeyed. It is nevertheless in the power of man to extend the lives of individual vegetable beings far beyond the period apparently assigned by nature; and parts of the same annual plant may be preserved through many years, perhaps through ages, though it cannot be rendered immortal.’ Also see Darwin’s abstract (DAR 74:60). ‘p. 252. Mr. K. allows even life of annual might be prolonged for vast period. though not for eternity—the roots appear younger than the branches, or more vigorous.’ see also E184.  then the conclusion that the two kinds of generation have some most important difference is forced on us.—See B1.

This type is well characterized, only in the adult. The deviations from it are the more strongly marked the nearer the animal is to the period of its birth. If, therefore, there were any species existing in circumstances unfavourable to their further development, they might possibly long subsist under a type very different from that which nature had designed for them. The proteus anguiformis appears to be of this number. The facts above mentioned tend to confirm this opinion. The proteus anguiformis lives in the subterraneous waters of Carniola, where the absence of light unites with the low temperature of those lakes, in preventing the development of the peculiar form of the adult.’ (p. 210).  p. 112.

We now possess a further cross by the impregnation of Altaclarae by arborum, which will probably come so near the father in its colour, that if, as expected, it should be able to endure our winters, we shall have nearly attained the result, which would be otherwise most likely impracticable, of acclimating the magnificent Nepal plant; for it does not appear that in reality any plant becomes acclimated under our observation, except by crossing with a hardier variety, or by the accidental alteration of constitution in some particular seedling;’ Darwin underlined ‘In constitution . . . both parents’. On ‘We now . . . endure our winters’ (and the previous sentence) he commented: ‘How exactly similar to giving dash of courage to greyhounds by Bull-dogs blood’ (see C120). He also underlined ‘accidental . . . seedling’ and commented: ‘This is like sudden appearance of cowslip from primrose it is analogous to Australian dogs, pro- ducing piebald young.’ Now Sir. J.

Bell 1833:145−49, ‘We do perceive surprising changes in the conformation of animals. Some of them are very familiar to us; but all show a foreknowledge and a prospective plan,—an alteration gradually taking place in preparation for the condition, never consequent upon it.— (pp. 145−46). ‘For example, if we examine the larva of a winged insect, we shall see the provisions for its motion over the ground, in that condition, all admirably supplied in the arrangement of its muscles, and the distribution of its nervous system. But if, anticipating its metamorphosis, we dissect the same larva immediately before the change, we shall find a new apparatus in progress towards perfection; the muscles of its many feet are seen decaying; the nerves to each muscle are wasting; a new arrangement of muscles, with new points of attachment, directed to the wings instead of the feet, is now visible; and a new distribution of nerves is distinctly to be traced, accommodated to the parts which are now to be put in motion. Here is no budding and stretching forth under the influence of the surrounding elements; but a change operated on all the economy, and prospective, that is, in reference to a condition which the creature has not yet attained.’ (pp. 147−48). See also p. 149: ‘Every thing declares the species to have its origin in a distinct creation, not in a gradual variation from some original type; and any other hypothesis than that of a new creation of animals suited to the successive changes in the inorganic matter of the globe—the condition of the water, atmosphere, and temperature—brings with it only an accumulation of difficulties.’ p. 203 Chætodon squirting water at fly.— instinct, for how could experience teach distances in air, in which it never touches objects.—C. Bell 1833:202−203, ‘We have a more curious instance of the precision of the eye and of the adaptation of muscular action in the choetodon rostratus. This fish inhabits the Indian rivers, and lives on the smaller aquatic flies. When it observes one alighted on a twig or flying near (for it can shoot them on the wing) it darts a drop of water with so steady an aim as to bring the fly down into the water, where it falls an easy prey. . . . Whether led to admire the wonderful power of instinct in these inferior creatures, or the property acquired by our own eye, we must acknowledge here a compound operation.*’ Bell’s note *: ‘In these instances a difficulty will readily occur to the reader; how does the fish judge of position, since the rays of light are refracted at the surface of the water? Does instinct enable it to do this, or is it by experience?’ far better case than chicken pecking fly.—“whilst the shell stuck to its tail” as mentioned by Sir. J. Banks. p. 212.—C. Bell 1833:212, ‘The late Sir Joseph Banks, in his evening conversations, told us that he had seen, what many perhaps have seen,  p. 282. Allows this instinctive power in chicken, yet says it is evidently acquired by experience in babyC. Bell 1833:282, ‘This faculty of searching for the object is slowly acquired in the child; and, in truth, the motions of the eye are made perfect, like those of the hand, by slow degrees. ... It is no contradiction to this, that the faculty of vision is made perfect in the young of some animals from the beginning; no more than that the instinct of the duck, when it runs to the water the moment that the shell is broken, should contradict the fact that the child learns to stand and walk after a thousand repeated efforts.’  '",

Where Whewell writes: ‘We have, I think, been led, by our survey of the history of Botany, to this point;—that a Natural Method directs us to the study of Physiology, as the only means by which we can reach the object.’ (3:342, Darwin’s underlining), Darwin first responds in defense: ‘Systematic Naturalists are the heralds of Nature’ (3:342 top), then he pours out a long series of ‘physiological’ notes and queries. can be traced to a germ, endowed with the vital principle,Müller 1838−42, 1 [June 1838]:24, ‘. . . as Baer first discovered, liver, salivary glands, and pancreas are in the further progress of the vegetative process really developed from that which appears to be merely the rudiment of the intestinal canal. It can no longer be doubted that the germ is not the miniature of the future being with all its organs, as Bonnet and Haller believed, but is merely “potentially”this being, with the specific vital force of which it is enbued, and which it becomes “actually” by development, and by the production of the organs essential to the active state of the “actual” being. For the germ itself is formed merely of amorphous matter, and a high magnifying power is not necessary to dis- tinguish the first rudiments of the separate organs, which from their first appearance are distinct and pretty large, but simple; so that the later complicated state of a particular organ can be seen to arise by transformation from its simple rudiment.’ Passage scored in pencil. Darwin commented in brown ink ‘very good’ (in the margin) and ‘Now in a bud, we must suppose there is one particle of old organized structure.— a filament of old nerve.’ (at top of page).

The mass of the people would, upon this supposition, be obliged to live worse, and a greater number of them would be crowded together in one house; and these natural causes would evidently contribute to produce sickness, even though the country, absolutely considered, might not be crowded and populous.’ do p. 529. “It accords with the most liberal! spirit of philosophy to believe that no stone can fall, or plant rise, without the immediate agency of the deity. But we know from experience! that these operations of what we call nature, have been conducted almost! invariably according to fixed laws: And since the world began, the causes of population & depopulation have been probably as constant as any of the laws of nature with which we are acquainted.”—Malthus 1826, 1:529. Instead of ‘deity’ Malthus wrote ‘divine power’. The underlinings and exclamation marks are Darwin’s. The passage begins: ‘In New Jersey the proportion of births to deaths, on an average of 7 years, ending with 1743, was 300 to 100. In France and England the average proportion cannot be reckoned at more than 120 to 100. Great and astonishing as this difference is, we ought not to be so wonder-struck at it, as to attribute it to the miraculous interposition of Heaven. The causes of it are not remote, latent and mysterious, but near us, round about us, and open to the investigation of every inquiring mind.’ this applies to one species— I would apply it not only to population & depopulation, but extermination & production of new forms.— their number & corelations    '",

'Though the unnatural hermaphrodite be a mixture of both sexes, and may possess the parts peculiar to each in perfection, yet it cannot possess in perfection that part which is common to both.'  those which perform very different, are both present in every shade of perfectionHunter 1837:35. Hunter's text: 'The unnatural hermaphroditeb, I believe, now and then occurs in every tribe of animals having distinct sexes, but is more common in some than in others;*' Hunter's note *: 'Quere: Is there ever, in the genera of animals that are natural hermaphrodites, a separation of the two parts forming distinct sexes? If there is, it may account for the distinction of sexes ever having happened.' Owen's note b: 'The unnatural hermaphrodites may be divided into those in which the parts peculiar to the two sexes are blended together in different proportions, and the whole body participates of a neutral character, tending towards the male and female as the respective organs predominate, and into those in which the male and female organs occupy respectively separate halves of the body, and impress on each lateral moiety the characteristics of the sex.' Darwin (see D174, note 6) substitutes 'abortive hermaphrodite' for 'unnatural hermaphrodite'.—How came it nipples are though abortive, are so plain in Man, & yet no trace of abortive womb, or ovarium.— or testicles in female.—See Hunter 1837:36−37, 'Although it may not be necessary, to constitute an hermaphrodite ... so readily as the scrotum.' Darwin's comment reflects his reading, but not abstracting, this passage. the add presence of both testes & ovaria in Hermaphrodite,— but not of pœnis & clitoris,Hunter 1837:36−37, 'Although it may not be necessary, to constitute an hermaphrodite, that the parts peculiar to the one sex should be blended with those of the other, in the same way that the penis is with the clitoris, yet this sometimes takes place in parts whose use in the distinct sexes is somewhat similar, the testicle and ovarium sometimes forming one body, without the properties of either.' shows to my mind.— , that both are present in every animals, but unequally developed.— surely analogy of molluscs.Refers to D157 above, 'In Pectinibr Mollusca.—or Cephalopoda are there abortive traces of other sexual organs; for if so, separation of sexes very simple.—'& neuter bee would shew this—See Hunter 1837:453−54 (Observations on Bees).

Darwin wrote two notes: ‘Probably stigma would actually prefer pollen of other plant; as stigma remains open to choice—& as in Mammalia bred in & in, loose passion (but I do not know whether perhaps other kind)—’ and ‘My theory explains this: because offspring differ in the two cases, in one going back to parent, & in other remaining constant.’ as it tends to show my view of infertility of hybrids with parent species false, which makes it determined by a facility in returning to old type ",

We have no reason to suspect there is a greater difference between our minds than between our forms; of which, though there are no two alike, yet there is a general similitude that goes through the whole race of mankind; and those who have cultivated their taste can distinguish what is beautiful or deformed, or, in other words, what agrees with or what deviates from the general idea of nature, in one case, as well as in the other.’ Thus Darwin’s idea about the general sense of beauty which only differs in degree in different races is supported by Reynolds: but neither gives an explanation of how it is acquired.   but it does not explain the feeling in any one man.—    '",

Hunter's text: 'The subjects themselves may be valuable, and may partly explain their connection with those related to them, so as in some measure to establish their place in naturea, but they cannot do it entirely; they only give us the form and construction, but leave us in other respects to conjecture, many of them requiring further observation relative to their oeconomy.' Owen's note a: 'It is interesting to meet with these indications of the spirit in which Hunter prosecuted his zoological researches. To ascertain the affinities of the animals whose structure he explored, or, in other words, to establish a natural system of classification, was not less the aim of Hunter than the determination of the functions of the different organs in the animal frame; and the truth of the remark of the necessity of combining observation of the living habits of animals, with anatomical and zoological research, in order to establish entirely their place in nature, as well as to fully understand their oeconomy, is now universally admitted.' p. 483.

Wales are generally compelled to traverse in order to quench their thirst”—Hunter 1837:483 note, 'Many have been the conjectures respecting the final intention of the premature birth of the marsupial animal, and the various singular modifications of structure necessitated by, and adapted to that circumstance. Since it obtains in quadrupeds of almost every variety of form, and with various modes of locomotion and diversity of diet, it must result from some more general law than individual proportions or habits of the parent. It is associated with a marked inferiority of cerebral organization; . . . Long-continued droughts and a scarcity of freshwater streams are amongst the most striking features of the climate and territory of Australia; and when we reflect that the principal exceptions to the marsupial organization, viz. the Ornithorhynchus and the Hydromys, or water-rat of the colonists, habitually inhabit the freshwater ponds, the peculiarities of the re-production above described may have reference to the great distances which the mammalia of New South Wales are generally compelled to traverse in order to quench their thirst.'

It is rooted in B4−5. these changes may be effect of differences of parents, or external circumstances during life.—if the circumstances which induce which must be external change are always of one nature species is formed if not.— the changes oscillate backwards & forwards & are individual differences (hence every individual is different).

This would be consistent with viewing the independence of variation and adaptive ability noted in D174 as first fruits of Darwin\\'s new theory of natural selection. If so the passage could have been written as late as 16 October 1838. The passages referred to in notes D177−2 and D174−2 are so strongly reminiscent of early Notebook B that they may reflect a rereading of his \\'Zoonomia arguements\\'.

(edited by Owen) p. 34.— Owen classifies Hermaphrodites.Hunter 1837:34−35 (Account of the free-martin). Owen's classification is given in a note on the following passage by Hunter: 'The natural hermaphrodite belongs to the inferior and more simple genera of animals, of which there is a much greater number than of the more perfect; and as animals become more complicated, have more parts, and each part is more confined to its particular use, separation of the two necessary powers for generation seems also to take place.' Owen's note begins: 'The animals in which the organs of the two sexes are naturally combined in the same individual are confined to the invertebrate division, and are most common in the molluscous and radiate classes. If the term hermaphrodite may be applied to those species which propagate without the concourse of the sexes, but in which no distinct male organ can be detected, as well as to those in which both male and female organs are present in the same body, then there may be distinguished three kinds of hermaphroditism.' Darwin's abstract of the rest of the note runs from 'Cryptandrous' to 'nematoid Entozoa'. Cryptandrous. (only female organs visible). Oyster. cystic Entozoa. Echinoderms. Acalephes. Polyps. Sponges Heautandrous, male organs formed to fecundate female (as in plants)The information in parentheses is not in Owen's note. Cirrhipeds rotifers, trematode & cestoid Entozoa Allotriandrous.Darwin leaves out Owen's definition (Hunter 1837:35): 'the male organs are so disposed as not to fecundate the ova of the same body, but where the concourse of two individuals is required, notwithstanding the co-existence in each of the organs of the two sexes.' or M Mollusca, with pectinibranchiate order—Owen (Hunter 1837:35) has 'with the exception of the pectibranchiate order'. the Annelida.

For my own part, I cannot but think it an inadequate conception of the Creator, to assume it as granted that his combinations are exhausted upon any one of the theatres of their former exercise, though in this, as in all his other works, we are led, by all analogy, to suppose that he operates through a series of intermediate causes, and that in consequence the origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our cognizance, would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process— although we perceive no indications of any process actually in progress which is likely to issue in such a result.’ Darwin had met Herschel in Cape Town in June 1836. The ‘mystery of mysteries’ passage first appeared in print in the first edition of Babbage’s treatise, which was published in 1837. However, E59 is the first evidence that Darwin read, or knew of, the passage. However, RN32 shows that Darwin and Herschel discussed at least the geological content of the letter, which was published in Herschel 1833−38. In the opening passage of the Origin Darwin alludes to Herschel’s letter. Origin:1, ‘When on Board H.M.S. ‘Beagle’, as naturalist, I was much struck with certain facts . . . These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species—that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers.’     page crossed pencil   '",

If there is, it may account for the distinction of sexes ever having happenedc.' Owen's notec: 'The separation of the two sexual organs from one another in the same body occurs in many of that class of natural hermaphrodites which we have termed 'allotriandrous'; and there are many examples in the Hunterian collection showing the fact. What, therefore, Mr. Hunter seems here to refer to is a spontaneous fission of the body in the interval separating the two sexual parts, so that one portion of the body shall contain the male and the other the female organs. Some annellides, as the Naїs. exhibit the phenomenon of spontaneous fission, but the separation never occurs so as to divide the two sexual organs from one another, and appropriate one to each division; and were even such an occurrence to be supposed ever to take place, the application of the fact to explain the occurrence of the distinct sexes in the naturally dioecious classes seems more worthy of a speculatist of the Lamarckian school than of a sober observer of Nature.'

Also see QE2: Questions Regarding Plants, (11), ‘Is not non-flowering gorze common in Norway No’. Now Mr Knights statements about fruit trees. grafted. altering is hostile to this:Knight 1818a:160. ‘New varieties of fruit are generally supposed, by gardeners, to be obtainable from seedling plants only; and every part of each seedling tree, which has been detached as a graft or bud, is usually believed to be capable of affording fruit of the same kind, if subsequently grafted upon the same stock, and cultivated in the same manner. This opinion I also formerly entertained; though I was always at a loss to account for the existence of many kinds, which were obviously different, and which yet much more closely resembled each other, than any varieties which I had ever been able to obtain from seeds. But I am now most perfectly satisfied, that many varieties of fruit, which are supposed to be totally distinct, have been propagated from branches of the same original tree; and that few, if any, varieties of fruit can, with strict propriety, be called permanent, when propagated by buds or grafts. ‘I have witnessed many instances of the variations above mentioned, but much the most extraordinary of these occurred in my garden, in the last autumn. A tree of the Yellow Magnum Bonum Plum . . . had always borne fruit of the usual colour; but, in the last year, one of its branches produced red fruit in every respect perfectly similar to the well known Red Magnum Bonum Plum. ... I am most perfectly confident, that . . . the branches above-mentioned had [not] sprung from an inserted bud or graft; and I can not therefore hesitate to decide, that the Red Magnum Bonum Plum is a variety only of the Yellow.’ See also Darwin’s abstract (DAR 74:58). ‘p. 160 Mr. K. says tree of Yellow Magnum Bonum, 40 years old, had always borne ordinary fruit, produced a branch yielding Red Magnum Bonum.— Also he had a My Duke Cherry. one branch of which (certainly not grafted) always produce more oblong fruit & later than the other branches.— The Green-gale. Golden Pippin & Non-pareil have sported considerably by being often grafted. “few if any varieties of fruit can with strict propriety be called permanent when propagated by buds or grafts”.— p. 160.—>[so that propagation by seed merely exposes the plant to external influences more completely, than it is exposed during life: .—No doubt these changes during life might be propagated.’ but on other hand, fruit trees are propagated by means, which wild plants never are, namely on stocks of other varieties & we know that the kind of stock greatly affects the Graft.—∦Plants circumstanced as the Gorze must be propagated by its roots: now it is curious Mr K. has observed that to graft from the roots is the best way to get young trees, from worn-out   '",

See Darwin’s abstract (DAR 74:61−62), ‘p. 199. “M. J. B.Van Mons on the cultivation of Brussel Sprouts” This plant has been much said to sp degenerate.— in soil of Brussels it remains true & at Louvain, but at Malines (same distance from Brussels as Louvain), where greatest attention paid to growth of vegetables deviates from its character after first sowing. (yet at Brussels grow in any soil, sandy or clayey, fields, or gardens)—true seeds sent to Malines produced the sports in their true form: seeds from these being preserved did not yield gave plants, “in which the Sprouts did not form little cabbages, but were expanded; nor did they shoot again at the axils of the stem”. Plants raised from these “only produced lateral shoots with weak pendant leaves, & tops similar to the shoots; so that in 3 generations the entire character of the original was lost”.— [NB the influence must be on plant in its life time]> Seeds from the degenerated plant were sent back to Louvain & planted, the young retained their character throughout their growth; sowed their seed, the plant regained as much of its character, as it had lost in second generation: resown, & in 3d generation not to be distinguished from the true kind: [this sudden assuming character analogous to primrose & cowslip case.—?]>.—>[very curious case. showing effects of external conditions.—’& depends on character of antecedent races.—For further primrose to cowslip analogues from this period, see Darwin’s abstract of Wilbraham 1818:60 (DAR 74:58), ‘p. 60. The French call Nectarine a smooth Peach.— certainly same.— the appearance of Nectarines on branch of Peach trees, analogous to production of cowslips from primroses, with no intermediate gradations.—’ and see Herbert 1837:347, ‘. . . it does not appear that in reality any plant becomes acclimated under our observation, except by crossing with a hardier variety, or by the accidental alteration of constitution in some particular seedling;’ Darwin underlined ‘accidental . . . seedling’ and commented: ‘This is like sudden appearance of cowslip from primrose it is analogous to Australian dogs, producing piebald young’. See also E111−1 for this passage in the context of acclimation.& yet in all probability the Brussels Sprout was slowly formed.— if it shall be difficult to show that time the fixity of characters from antiquity prevents their variation, which is not improbable as Mr Herbert does not seem to recognize any difference in crossing between varieties & species,See letter of 5 April 1839 from William Herbert (Correspondence 2:182−85), ‘It stands to reason that the pollen of a plant which is not disposed to produce varieties must be less likely to produce hybrids of uniform appearance, than that of a plant which is not disposed to sport; but I consider the pollen of a permanent garden variety just as likely to produce an uniform effect as that of any easily convertible natural species. Take for instance the hollyhocks of the garden, without question cultivated varieties of one plant, yet steadily reproducing their respective colours by seed. I apprehend that the pollen of one variety of hollyhock on another would be neither more nor less decisive than that of one wild species of Calceolaria on another, at least taking the species wh. have similar constitutions & intermingle easily.’ This forms part of Herbert’s reply to Queries 1 and 2 of ‘Questions for Mr Herbert’(Correspondence 2:182). Darwin’s marginal comment on Herbert 1837:358, probably played a part in the way Darwin framed Queries 1 and 2: ‘seems to leave out of question, greater indelibility of some stocks than others’. The importance Darwin attached to Herbert’s rejection of ‘Yarrell’s law’ is to be seen in Darwin’s notes on his exchange with Herbert (Correspondence 2:204, CD memorandum following Herbert’s letter of c. 27 June 1839), ‘Mr Herbert considers without doubt old variety more likely to reproduce itself than new—but he throws doubt on this, as if not necessarily effect of ages, but of the chances.— ‘Negatives a relation between facility in sporting and hybridisation.— . . . but believes there would be no difference between a permanent variety and easily convertible species: all facts about the reappearance of character must be inferred from the animal kingdom. ‘The non relation of hybridizing power & variation goes far to overturn my views of fixity of character, being dependent on age, & consequently on time after certain period having any further effect on characters.— . . . The fixity of characterresistance to hybridisation being consequence of oldage of species (inexplicable by Mr Herbert) is so simple an explanation, that I can hardly give it up, though thesesome species varying & yet not hybridising almost overthrows it.—’   yet the amount of   '",

See Erasmus Darwin 1794, 1:102, ‘The individuals of the vegetable world may be considered as inferior or less perfect animals; a tree is a congeries of many living buds, and in this respect, resembles the branches of coralline, which are a congeries of a multitude of animals.’ See also Litchfield 1915, 2:177, ‘At present [Charles] is treating Drosera just like a living creature, and I suppose he hopes to end in proving it to be an animal.’ See also Raverat 1960:157−58, for a dis¬cussion of the ‘Elephant Tree’ that stood beside the sand-walk at Down.

En effet, beaucoup de végétaux sont hermaphrodites, en sorte que l’individu qui possède les deux sexes, se suffit à lui-même pour la fécondation: mais dans les animaux en qui les deux sexes existent, il n’est pas encore prouvé, par l’observation, que chaque individu se suffise à lui-même; et l’on sait que quantité de mollusques, réellement hermaphrodites, se fécondent néanmoins les un les autres. A la véritée, parmi les mollusques hermaphrodites, ceux qui ont une coquille bivalve, et qui sont fixés comme les huîtres, semblent devoir se féconder eux-mêmes: il est cependant possible qu’ils se fécondent mutuellement par la voie du milieu dans lequel ils sont plongés. S’il en est ainsi, il n’y a, dans les animaux, que les hermaphrodites imparfaits; et l’on sait que dans les animaux vertébrés, il n’y a même aucun individu véritablement hermaphrodite.

Or, par des répétitions fréquentes de pareils sauts dans les individus de ces races, la peau de leurs flancs s’est dilatée de chaque côté en une membrane lâche qui réunit les pattes postérieures à celles de devant, et qui, embrassant un grand volume d’air, les empêche de tomber brusquement. Ces animaux sont encore sans membranes entre les doigts.’ says lemur.— volans, has skin between its legs. —— strangely consider existing long-organized forms as parent forms of existing highly organized forms—Lamarck 1830, 2:455, ‘Les galéopithèques (lemur volans), plus anciens sans doute dans la même habitude que les écureuils volans (pteromis Geoffr.), ont la peau des flancs plus ample, plus développée encore, réunissant non-seulement les pattes postérieures aux antérieures, mais en outre les doigts entr’eux, et la queue avec les pieds de Derrière.’ This passage is in ‘Additions Relatives aux Chapitres VII et VIII de la première partie’. this resulted from the necessity of supposing some inward progressive developing power.—See inter alia Lamarck 1830, 1:65, ‘Que la faculté d’accroissement dans chaque portion du corps organiséétant inhérente aux premiers effets de la vie, elle a donné lieu aux différens modes de multiplication et de régénération des individus; et que par-là les progrès acquis dans la composition de l’organisation et dans la forme et la diversité des parties, ont été conservés;’.

Such conclusions throw a new light on the adaptation of the attributes and migratory habits of animals and plants, to the changes which are unceasingly in progress in the inanimate world. It is clear that the duration of species is so great, that they are destined to outlive many important revolutions in the physical geography of the earth; and hence those innumerable contrivances for enabling the subjects of the animal and vegetable creation to extend their range, the inhabitants of the land being often carried across the ocean, and the aquatic tribes over great continental spaces. It is obviously expedient that the terrestrial and fluviatile species should not only be fitted for the rivers, valleys, plains, and mountains which exist at the era of their creation, but for others that are destined to be formed before the species shall become extinct.’ Darwin scored the passage and wrote: ‘Capital!’ if true important on my view.—     aneighbouring] underlined pencil bformed in . . . like Sicily] added pencil    '",

We do not argue that such must be the groupe, because such and such are, in our opinion, good and distinct characters; but we say, such happens to be the character, of no matter what importance, which prevails throughout the groupe, and which serves in some degree to insulate it from other groupes. But it is evident that we must previously have arrived at the knowledge of the groupe; and this is effected by a close watching of the variation of affinity, and by considering the groupe to be complete only when the series of natural objects returns into itself.' Passage scored. p. 7. “ The Natural arrangement of animals themselves is the question in point.” Now what is natural arrangement,— affinities, what is that, amount of resemblance,— how can we estimate this amount, when value no scale of value of difference is or can be settled,—MacLeay 1838:7, 'If even we were right in any such comparative estimate of the importance of organs in general economy, we ought not to forget that the true question under consideration is, the natural arrangement of the animals themselves; and that this is to be attained only by the expression of every affinity, and every analogy that can be detected.' Darwin underlined 'the natural arrangement' and commented: 'It may be asked what is meant by Natural arrangement— first step vague.— if it is said affinities of animal.— what does affinities mean?' At the bottom of the page he noted: 'Most resemblances— evidently disputed,—sum of difference[.] I conceive object is real relationship'. I believe affinity may be taken literally,, though how far we can ever discover the real relationship is doubtful.— not till much knowledge is elicited.— It will rest upon the discovery what characters VARY most easily:— those which do not vary being foundation for chief divisions.= p. 7.

Yet this will be an incorrect mode of viewing the matter; for owing to the rarity of its species, the first known circular grouping of the species of Cryptodinus, for instance, is into sub-genera; whereas the first known circular grouping of the species of Cetoniidae is into certain sub-sections.'

Bell 1833:94.“The resemblance of the foot the Ostrich to that of the Camel has not escaped Naturalists.” Before he alludes to the resemblances of the snout of the mole & Pig in having two additional bones to give strength to it.—C. Bell 1833:68−69n, ‘The [mole’s] snout may vary in its internal structure with new offices. Naturalists say that there is a new “element” in the pig’s nose; it has, in fact, two bones which admit of motion, whilst they give more strength. Moles have those bones also, as they plough the earth with their snouts.’ p. 139. Doubts altogether the law of balancing of organs.—C. Bell 1833:139, ‘In the batrachian order, the ribs are wanting: where then are we to look for them? Shall we follow a system which informs us that when a bone is wanting in the cavity of the ear we are to seek for it in the jaw; and which, yet, shall leave us in the contemplation of this class of animals deficient in thirty-two ribs, without pointing out where they are to be found, or how their elements are built up in other structures? If, on the contrary, we take the principle that parts are formed or withdrawn, with a never failing relation to the function which is to be performed, we see that no sooner are the compages of the chest removed, and the shoulder thus deprived of support, than the bones to which the extremity is fixed are expanded and varied, both in form and articulation, so as to fulfil their main object of giving security and a centre of motion to the arm.’ In the Batracian Order the 32 ribs are wanting. p. 144 in the Icthyosaurus 60 or 70 bones in the paddle, yet all in the arm are perfect.—C. Bell 1833:144. p. 144.— Alludes to two theories;— that species are the result of circumstances,;— or the will of the Animal.C. Bell 1833:144−45, ‘It is, above all, surprising with what perverse ingenuity men seek to obscure the conception of a Divine Author, an intelligent, designing, and benevolent Being—rather clinging to the greatest absurdities, or interposing the cold and inanimate influence of the mere “elements,” in a manner to extinguish all feeling of dependence in our minds, and all emotions of gratitude. ‘Some will maintain that all the varieties which we see, are the result of a change of circumstances influencing the original animal; or that new organs have been produced by a desire and consequent effort of the animal to stretch and mould itself—that, as the leaves of a plant expand to light, or turn to the sun, or as the roots shoot to the appropriate soil, so do the exterior organs of animals grow and adapt themselves. We shall presently find that an opinion has prevailed that the organization of animals has determined their propensities; but the philosophers, of who we are now speaking, imagine the contrary,—that under the influence of new circumstrances, organs have accommodated themselves, and assumed their particular forms.’    '",

Brown 1833:728, ‘Pollen masses of Asclepias purpurascens being applied to the stigma of Epipactis palustris, and immersed in its viscid secretion, the dehiscence, contrary to expectation, not only took place, but even more speedily than usual, that is within twenty-four hours. Some of the grains were also found discharged from the mass unchanged, while others, both discharged and still inclosed, had begun to produce tubes.’ See abstract (DAR 74:169−72) and Darwin’s questions for Brown and replies (DAR 74:173−74).  now Mr Herbert has shown that stigma swells, when pollen even most remote is put to it.See Herbert 1837:350, ‘The whole of my observations has led me to think, that at any period before the decay of the stigma the access of the natural pollen may supersede the influence of the foreign that may have been previously applied, if not from a closely allied species or variety; but that on the other hand no foreign pollen can act upon the germen after the stigma has been fertilized naturally.’ Passage double scored.

[that in contrast to mind], is a creative power modifying matter, blindly and unconsciously, according to the laws of adaptation.’ (1:25), the ‘vital force’ (1:24 et seq.), the ‘vis essentialis’ (1:48), etc. In Darwin’s evolutionary translation this ‘organizing’ force is capable of varying under the influence of ‘external agencies’ that Müller calls ‘the vital stimuli’ (e.g. ‘caloric, water, atmospheric air, and nutriment . . . that . . . induce constant changes in the composition of the organised body’, 1:29). In animals these include the ‘internal vital stimulus’ of the nerves through ‘their active force, probably an imponderable agent’ (1:30).

Garden having coloured offspring.—Hunter 1837:330 (Observations tending to show that the wolf, jackal, and dog, are all of the same species). Hunter's text: 'As animals are known to produce young which are different from themselves in colour, form, and dispositions, arising from what may be called the un- natural mode of life, it shows this curious power of accommodation in the animal oeconomy, that although education can produce no change in the colour, form, or disposition of the animal, yet it is capable of producing a principle which becomes so natural to the animal that it shall beget young different in coloura and form, and so altered in disposition as to be more easily trained up to the offices in which they have been usually employed, and having these dispositions suitable to such change of form.' Owen's note a: 'This has recently been exemplified in the produce of a male and female Dingo, or wild dog of Australia, brought forth at the Zoological Gardens, and under circumstances which precluded the possibility of connection between the female and any other dog than the male with which she was kept confined. Two, out of the litter of five puppies brought forth, had the uniform red-brown colour of the parents, the rest were more or less pied, brown and white.' but surely in all these cases an unseen change is produced in parents—colour is a doubtful subject, but what other instances are there of such changes, not acquired by parent, being handed down?     page crossed pencil   \"",

Every structure is capable of innumerable variations,See E22: ‘every part is under change, now one part now another’. as long as each shall be perfectly adapted to circumstances of times.See Macculloch Abstract, 205.5:58v, ‘I look at every adaptation, as the surviving one of ten thousand trials.— each step being perfect to the then existing conditions.—or nearly so ...although having hereditary superfluities Man could exist without Mammæ.’& from persistency owing to their slow formation these variations tend to accumulate. on any structure.See E4, E9, and E17. Darwin’s concern with the concept of adaptation here and in E71 is reflected in his notes on two works he was reading at the time: Müller’s Physiology (1838−42) and Whewell’s History of the Inductive Sciences (1837). See note E69−1. For example, where Müller writes, ‘This law of organic conformation,— adaptation to an end,— regulates the form, not only of entire organs, but also of the simplest elementary tissues.’ (Müller 1838−42, 1 [June 1838]:20), Darwin altered—in brown ink—‘adaptation to an end’ to ‘(as the effect of) adaptation to(varying) circumstances’. Similarly Darwin ‘rewrites’ Whewell on adaptation: ‘“I take care”, says Geoffroy, “not to ascribe to God any intention.” And when Cuvier speaks of the combination of organs in such order that they may be in consistence with the part which the animal has to play in nature; his rival rejoins, “I know nothing of animals which have to play a part in nature.”’ (Whewell 1837, 3:461−62), Darwin inserts after Cuvier’s ‘has to play’—‘thus qualified is correct: Owing to external contingencies & numbers of other allied species & not owing to mandate of God’. Darwin goes further than rejecting providential adaptation. On Whewell’s ‘The use of every organ has been discovered by starting from the assumption that it must have some use.’ (3:468), Darwin substituted ‘relation’ for ‘use’ and commented: ‘Shrivelled wings of those non-flying Coleoptera?! In every science, one may trust that every fact has some relation to whole world.—’ (top of page) and ‘In every animal, final cause,, or adaptation is applicable to far greatest proportion of structure for otherwise it would be pressed’ (bottom of page). Whewell goes on to quote Kant: ‘“It is well known that the anatomisers of plants and animals, in order to investigate their structure, . . . assume, as indispensably necessary, this maxim, that in such a creature nothing is in vain,and proceed upon it in the same way in which in general natural philosophy we proceed upon the principle that nothing happens by chance. In fact, they can as little free themselves from this teleological principle as from the general physical one; . . .’ (3:470). Darwin scored the passage and commented: ‘All this reasoning is vitiated; when we look at animals on my view.’ Whewell concludes: ‘It appears to me, therefore, that whether we judge from the arguments, the result, the practice of physiologists, their speculative opinions, or those of the philosophers of a wider field, we are led to the same conviction, that in the organized world we may and must adopt the belief, that organization exists for its purpose, and that the apprehension of the purpose may guide us in seeing the meaning of the organization.’ (3:470−71). Darwin commented: ‘When a man inherits a harelip, or a diseased liver is this adaptation.—as much as Bullfin to linseed doubtless it is in one sense, but not in that, in which these philosophers mean.’-->     page crossed pencil    '",

Vol II p. 319.— Habits more prevalent in proportion to intelligence less.—Lamarck 1830, 2:319, ‘Qui ne sent alors que le pouvoir des habitudes sur les actions doit être d’autant plus grand, que l’individu que l’on considère est moins doué d’intelligence, et a moins, par conséquent, la faculté de penser, de réfléchir, de combiner ses idées, en un mot, de varier ses actions.’ p. 325 to 29.— Habits becoming heredetary form the instincts of animals.— almost identical with my theory— no facts, & mingled with much hypothesis.—Lamarck 1830, 2:325­26, ‘…1’habitude d’exercer tel organe, ou telle partie du corps, pour satisfaire à des besoins qui renaissent souvent, donnoit au fluide subtil qui se déplace, lorsque s’opère la puissance qui fait agir, une si grande facilitéà se diriger vers cet organe, où il fut si souvent employé, que cette habitude devenoit en quelque sorte inhérente à la nature de l’individu, qui ne sauroit être libre d’en changer.   ‘Or, les besoins des animaux qui possèdent un système nerveux, étant, pour, chacun, selon l’organisation de ces corps vivans:  1. De prendre telle sorte de nourriture;  2. De se livrer à la fécondation sexuelle que sollicitent en eux certaines sensations;  3. De fuir la douleur;  4. De chercher le plaisir ou le bien­être.  ‘Ils contractent, pour satisfaire à ces besoins, diverses sortes d’habitudes, qui se transforment, en eux, en autant de penchans, auxquels ils ne peuvent résister, et qu’ils ne peuvent changer euxmêmes. De là, l’origine de leurs actions habituelles, et de leurs inclinations particulières, auxquelles on a donné le nom d’instinct (*).  (*) ‘De même que tous les animaux ne jouissent pas de la faculté d’exécuter des actes de volonté, de même pareillement l’instinct n’est pas le propre de tous les animaux qui existent; car ceux qui manquent de système nerveux, manquent aussi de sentiment intérieur, et ne sauroient avoir aucun instinct pour leurs actions.’‘Ces animaux imparfaits son entièrement passifs, n’opèrent rien par euxmêmes, ne ressentent aucun besoin, et la nature, à leur égard, pourvoit à tout, comme elle le fait relativement aux végétaux. Or, comme ils sont irritables dans leurs parties, les moyens que la nature emploie pour les faire subsister, leur font exécuter des mouvemens que nous nommons des actions. [End of footnote.]  ‘Ce penchant des animaux à la conservation des habitudes et au renouvellement des actions qui en proviennent, étant une fois acquis, se propage ensuite dans les individus, par la voie de la reproduction ou de la génération, qui conserve l’organisation et la dispositin des parties dans leur état obtenu; en sorte que ce même penchant existe déjà dans les nouveaux individus, avant même qu’ils l’aient exercé.  ‘C’est ainsi que les mêmes habitudes et le même instinct se perpétuent de générations en générations, dans les différentes espèces ou races d’animaux, sans offrir de variation notable, tant qu’il ne survient pas de mutation dans les circonstances essentielles à la manière de vivre.’ see M.S. notes, where strong argument in favour of brain forming the instincts,— could brain make a tune on the pianoforte, yes if every individual played a little, & something destroyed bad brain.

It seems more probable that these breeds having been long treated as they now are, and applied to the same uses, should have acquired habits by experience and instruction, which in course of time have become hereditary. . . . I am led to conclude, that by far the greater part of the propensities that are generally supposed to be instinctive, are not implanted in animals by nature, but that they are the result of long experience, acquired and accumulated through many generations, so as in the course of time to assume the character of instinct. . . . How far these observations may apply to the human race I do not pretend to say; I cannot, however, but think that part of what is called national character may, in some degree, be influenced by what I have endeavoured to prove, namely, that acquired habits become hereditary.’ very clearly, all I must do is to generalize it, & see whether applicable to all cases.—& analogize it with ordinary habits that is my new part of the view.— let the proof of heredetariness in habits. be considered. as grand step if it can be generalize.—    '",

Perception very different from emotion.— The former is used with regard to the senses. Reason does not lead to action.—Mackintosh 1837:152−53, ‘Perception and emotion are states of mind perfectly distinct; and an emotion of pleasure or pain differs much more from a mere per¬ception, than the perceptions of one sense do from those of another . . . Reason, as reason, can never be a motive to action. It is only when we superadd to such a being sensibility, or the capacity of emotion or sentiment (or what in corporeal cases is called sensation), of desire and aversion, that we introduce him into the world of action.’  p. 248. Theory of Association. owing to time when entered brain, try contiguity of parts of Brain.— Mackintosh first clearly insisted on assoc of ideas & emotions. rather ideas & bodily actions make the emotions.—Mackintosh 1837:248, ‘Both [Berkeley and Hume] agree in referring all the intellectual operations to the association of ideas, and in representing that association as reducible to the single law, that ideas which enter the mind at the same time, acquire a tendency to call up each other, which is in direct proportion to the frequency of their having entered together.’ Darwin wrote, ‘try theory of place in brain’ beside this latter statement.

Drawing on that data, CD moved from question to statement when he wrote in the Origin 1859: 445 \"…I was told that the foals of cart and race-horses differed as much as the full-grown animals; and this surprised me greatly, as I think it probable that the difference between these two breeds has been wholly caused by selection under domestication; but having had careful measurements made of the dam and of a three-days old colt of a race and heavy cart-horse, I find that the colts have by no means acquired their full amount of proportional difference.\" Thinks long-legged breed cd more easily be selected from foals, than from colts!!!
